%% Loop Review

clc, clear, close all

%% Problem 1:

clc, clear, close all

% Have the user input a number corresponding to the height of a mountain
% from the base in feet. Then, have the user input a number corresponding
% to the temperature at the base of the mountain in fahrenheit. 
% Verify both of these inputs are valid. If an input is not valid, 
% have the user enter it again until it is valid. Finally, return the 
% temperature at the top of the mountain by using this formula:
% tempTop = tempBottom - ((height / 1000) * 3.5)



%% Problem 2:

clc, clear, close all

% Have the user input a vector. Multiply each odd-indexed term by 5 and
% return the resulting vector.
% Example: [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,2,15,4,25]



%% Problem 3:

clc, clear, close all

% Have the user input a vector. Verify that each value in the vector is
% non-negative. If a vector is not valid, prompt the user to replace that 
% value. Then, multiply each odd-indexed term by 2 and each even-indexed 
% term by 3 and return the resulting vector.
% Example: [1,2,3,4,5] = [2,6,6,12,10]



%% Summary:

% 'while' loops are used when you need to repeat some amount of code an
% unknown/unpredictable amount of times.

% 'for' loops are used when you need to repeat some amount of code a 
% known/predictable amount of times.

% 'while' loops and 'for' loops are always interchangeable, if you are
% clever enough.

% Usually, 'while' loops will be used when you are verifying/validating
% data. However, remember there are certain cases where a 'for' loop could
% be more useful.

% Expect to see both 'while' and 'for' loops on Exam 2 and the Final Exam!
