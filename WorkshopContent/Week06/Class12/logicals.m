% Ask the user to enter a vector of the side lengths of their desired shape
%   (i.e. if the shape is a triangle, 3 side lengths should be entered)

% Using conditional statements, be able to print to the command window the
%   shape the user entered (i.e. if the shape is a triangle, print "Shape
%   is a triangle" to the command window)

% Be able to determine if the shape is a TRIANGLE, SQUARE, RECTANGLE,
%   PENTAGON, or HEXAGON
