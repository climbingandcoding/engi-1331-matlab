    Week 2 - Class 3 - 08/29/22

    This is a short activity that covers the basics of scalars, vectors, 
    and matrices in MATLAB. In this file, we will cover scalars, 
    row vectors, column vectors, matrices, transposing, 'length', 'size', 
    indexing, arithmetic, and modifying vectors/matrices.
