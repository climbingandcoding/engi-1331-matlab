% User input:
% A random vector will be useid in this ICP. The length of this vector is a
% user input. Prompt the user to enter the length of the vector to be created.

% Data validation:
% You want the length to be positive. If it is not do the following:
% If the length is less than zero, take the absolute value of it, and give
% a warning. If it is zero, give an error and terminate the program.

% Vector creation:
% Create a row vector of random integers with values from 0 to 100
% and store it in a variable named X. This row vector should have a length
% entered by the user.


% Create a function with function header: [Results] = function(V)
% Input:
%   V (numerical vector)
% Output:
%   Results (numerical matrix)

% Purpose: Write a function named MovingWindow that, given a vector, finds the
% values in that vector, that has a moving average above the current value.
% What does a moving average mean? Moving average for an element is equal
% to the average of three values:
% current value, the previous value and the next value.
% If the moving average is above the current value, then save the current
% value, its moving average and location as a row vector. If you have multiple cases,
% save the value, average and location for each such case as a new row.
